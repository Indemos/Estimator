# Maximum favorable excursion 

Every open position continuously experiences profit fluctuations. 
Every trade has its maximal profit and its maximal loss during the period between its opening and closing. 
MFE shows the maximal price movement in a favorable direction or potential profit that could be made. 
If securities measured in different units were traded, it is better to express results in money.

```
MAE = Sum(MaxProfit - Return) / N 
```

- Return - Balance afer trade 
- MaxProfit - Max unrealized profit during the trade
- N - Number of samples
