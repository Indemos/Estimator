# Maximum favorable excursion 

Every open position continuously experiences gain fluctuations. 
Every trade has its maximal gain and its maximal loss during the period between its opening and closing. 
MFE shows the maximal price movement in a favorable direction or potential gain that could be made. 
If securities measured in different units were traded, it is better to express results in money.

$$ MFE = \frac{ \sum\limits_{i=0}^{N}(MaxGain_i - V_i) }{N} $$ 

- V - Gain from transaction 
- MaxGain - Max unrealized gain during the transaction
- N - Number of transactions
