# MAR Ratio

MAR is a gain-to-pain ratio that is calculated by dividing CAGR by Maximum Drawdown.
For individual strategies, MAR ratio should be at least 0.5. 
Strategies with a MAR ratio above 1.0 are very impressive, but they are a lot harder to come by.
Calmar ratio can be calculated if returns are calculated for the past 36 months. 

```
MAR = CAGR / DD
```

For intraday strategies CAGR can be replaced with average returns.

```
MAR = Mean / DD
```

- CAGR - Compound average growth rate
- Mean - Average return
- DD - Maximum drawdown
