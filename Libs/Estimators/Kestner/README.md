# Kestner Ratio 

K-ratio measures risk versus return by analyzing how steady a portfolio's returns are over time. 
The K-ratio takes into account the returns, but also the order of those returns in measuring risk.
A higher k-ratio indicates a higher positive consistency in trading performance. 
A ratio higher than 2.0 or so is generally considered good.

$$ Slope = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Cov(X,X)} $$ 

$$ Error = \frac{Deviation}{\sqrt{N}} $$ 

$$ Ratio = \frac{Slope}{Error} $$

- Cov(X,Y) - Covariance between series
- Cov(X,X) - Variance of the regression line
- Deviation - Standard deviation
- N - Number of transactions
